# Smithery Configuration for Context Fabric
# https://smithery.ai/docs/registry/smithery-yaml

name: context-fabric
version: 0.7.1
description: |
  MCP server for agentic CLI memory and time-aware orientation. Provides semantic
  context management across sessions with a three-layer memory architecture
  (working, project, semantic), hybrid search (FTS5 BM25 + vector cosine + RRF),
  and a built-in time engine with IANA timezone support, natural-language date
  anchors, and offline-gap detection.

  Integrates with Kimi, Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, Gemini CLI, Cursor, and more.
  Runs locally (Node.js 22.5+) or via Docker (cross-platform, zero host dependencies).

    command: node dist/server.js

  build:
    description: Compile TypeScript
    command: npm run build

  test:
    description: Run test suite
    command: npm test

env:
  - name: CONTEXT_FABRIC_DIR
    description: Storage directory for L2/L3 databases
    default: ~/.context-fabric
    required: false

  - name: FASTEMBED_CACHE_PATH
    description: ONNX model cache directory (pre-set in Docker image)
    required: false

  - name: LOG_LEVEL
    description: Log level (debug, info, warn, error)
    default: info
    required: false

tools:
  - name: context.getCurrent
    description: Get current context window for a session (working memories, relevant memories, patterns, suggestions, ghost messages). Supports language/filePath filters for patterns.

  - name: context.store
    description: Store a memory — code pattern, bug fix, decision, convention, scratchpad, or relationship. SmartRouter auto-selects the layer.

  - name: context.recall
    description: "Hybrid search across all memory layers. Three modes: hybrid (FTS5+vector+RRF, default), semantic (vector-only), keyword (FTS5 BM25-only)."

  - name: context.orient
    description: "Orientation loop — answers: Where am I in time? What happened while I was offline? What project am I in? Also resolves date expressions and provides world-clock conversions."

  - name: context.summarize
    description: Condense old memories into a summary entry to keep context lean.

  - name: context.reportEvent
    description: Report CLI events (file opened, command executed, error occurred, etc.) for automatic memory capture.

  - name: context.searchCode
    description: Search the project's source code index. Supports text, symbol, and semantic search modes. Index is built automatically on first use.

  - name: context.get
    description: Get a specific memory by its ID. Searches across all layers (L1→L2→L3).

  - name: context.update
    description: "Update an existing memory's content, metadata, tags, weight, or pinned status. Use targetLayer to promote to a higher layer (L1→L2, L2→L3)."

  - name: context.delete
    description: Delete a memory by its ID. Searches across all layers and deletes from whichever layer it lives in.

  - name: context.list
    description: "List and browse memories with optional filters (type, tags). Supports pagination. Use stats: true to get memory store counts per layer."

  - name: context.setup
    description: Install and configure Context Fabric into any supported CLI's MCP config. Writes the config file automatically. Supports local (node) and Docker transports.

  features:
    - Three-layer memory architecture (L1 working/RAM, L2 project/SQLite, L3 semantic/SQLite+cosine)
    - "Hybrid search: FTS5 BM25 + vector cosine similarity, fused with Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)"
    - Time engine with IANA timezone support, natural-language date anchors, offline-gap detection
    - Orientation loop — session-start summary of time, project, and what changed while offline
    - Automatic context injection via ghost messages (in getCurrent response)
    - Semantic search with fastembed-js ONNX embeddings (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
    - Pattern detection and storage
    - Event-driven memory capture
    - Smart routing — auto-selects the optimal layer for each memory
    - Memory weighting (1-5) for priority-based recall
    - Pinned memories — exempt from decay and summarization
    - Self-installing — AI calls context.setup to configure any supported CLI
    - Docker transport — cross-platform stdio bridge, no host runtime required
    - Zero native dependencies — uses Node.js built-in node:sqlite
